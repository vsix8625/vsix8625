# env

#: Specify the environment variables to be set in all child processes.
#: Using the name with an equal sign (e.g. env VAR=) will set it to
#: the empty string. Specifying only the name (e.g. env VAR) will
#: remove the variable from the child process' environment. Note that
#: environment variables are expanded recursively, for example::

#:     env VAR1=a
#:     env VAR2=${HOME}/${VAR1}/b

#: The value of VAR2 will be <path to home directory>/a/b.

# watcher

# exe_search_path

#: Control where kitty finds the programs to run. The default search
#: order is: First search the system wide PATH, then ~/.local/bin and
#: ~/bin. If still not found, the PATH defined in the login shell
#: after sourcing all its startup files is tried. Finally, if present,
#: the PATH specified by the env option is tried.

#: This option allows you to prepend, append, or remove paths from
#: this search order. It can be specified multiple times for multiple
#: paths. A simple path will be prepended to the search order. A path
#: that starts with the + sign will be append to the search order,
#: after ~/bin above. A path that starts with the - sign will be
#: removed from the entire search order. For example::

#:     exe_search_path /some/prepended/path
#:     exe_search_path +/some/appended/path
#:     exe_search_path -/some/excluded/path

# update_check_interval 24

#: The interval to periodically check if an update to kitty is
#: available (in hours). If an update is found, a system notification
#: is displayed informing you of the available update. The default is
#: to check every 24 hours, set to zero to disable. Update checking is
#: only done by the official binary builds. Distro packages or source
#: builds do not do update checking. Changing this option by reloading
#: the config is not supported.

# startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session =none command line option
#: for individual instances. See sessions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#sessions> in the kitty
#: documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
#: in the path are expanded. Changing this option by reloading the
#: config is not supported.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 512

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.

# file_transfer_confirmation_bypass

#: The password that can be supplied to the file transfer kitten
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/transfer/> to skip the
#: transfer confirmation prompt. This should only be used when
#: initiating transfers from trusted computers, over trusted networks
#: or encrypted transports, as it allows any programs running on the
#: remote machine to read/write to the local filesystem, without
#: permission.

# allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink escape sequences (OSC 8). If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click with the mouse or by using the hints
#: kitten <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/>. The
#: special value of ask means that kitty will ask before opening the
#: link when clicked.

# shell_integration enabled

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. Set to
#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. It is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete, no-sudo. See Shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> for details.

# allow_cloning ask

#: Control whether programs running in the terminal can request new
#: windows to be created. The canonical example is clone-in-kitty
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#clone-shell>.
#: By default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request.
#: Allowing cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the
#: terminal (including over SSH) permission to execute arbitrary code,
#: as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the
#: terminal is running on.

# clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

#: Control what shell code is sourced when running clone-in-kitty in
#: the newly cloned window. The supported strategies are:

#: venv
#:     Source the file $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate. This is used by the
#:     Python stdlib venv module and allows cloning venvs automatically.
#: conda
#:     Run conda activate $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV. This supports the virtual
#:     environments created by conda.
#: env_var
#:     Execute the contents of the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_CODE with eval.
#: path
#:     Source the file pointed to by the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_PATH.

#: This option must be a comma separated list of the above values.
#: Only the first valid match, in the order specified, is sourced.

# notify_on_cmd_finish never

#: Show a desktop notification when a long-running command finishes
#: (needs shell_integration). The possible values are:

#: never
#:     Never send a notification.

#: unfocused
#:     Only send a notification when the window does not have keyboard focus.

#: invisible
#:     Only send a notification when the window both is unfocused and not visible
#:     to the user, for example, because it is in an inactive tab or its OS window
#:     is not currently active.

#: always
#:     Always send a notification, regardless of window state.

#: There are two optional arguments:

#: First, the minimum duration for what is considered a long running
#: command. The default is 5 seconds. Specify a second argument to set
#: the duration. For example: invisible 15. Do not set the value too
#: small, otherwise a command that launches a new OS Window and exits
#: will spam a notification.

#: Second, the action to perform. The default is notify. The possible
#: values are:

#: notify
#:     Send a desktop notification.

#: bell
#:     Ring the terminal bell.

#: command
#:     Run a custom command. All subsequent arguments are the cmdline to run.

#: Some more examples::

#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 5 seconds in an unfocused window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0
#:     # Ring a bell when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 bell
#:     # Run 'notify-send' when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send job finished

# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

# forward_stdio no

#: Forward STDOUT and STDERR of the kitty process to child processes
#: as file descriptors 3 and 4. This is useful for debugging as it
#: allows child processes to print to kitty's STDOUT directly. For
#: example, echo hello world >&3 in a shell will print to the parent
#: kitty's STDOUT. When enabled, this also sets the
#: KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED=3 environment variable so child processes
#: know about the forwarding.

# menu_map

#: Specify entries for various menus in kitty. Currently only the
#: global menubar on macOS is supported. For example::

#:    menu_map global "Actions::Launch something special" launch --hold --type=os-window sh -c "echo hello world"

#: This will create a menu entry named "Launch something special" in
#: an "Actions" menu in the macOS global menubar. Sub-menus can be
#: created by adding more levels separated by the :: characters.

#: }}}

# linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {fffacd{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt
#: (opt, option, ⌥), super (cmd, command, ⌘).

#: Simple shortcut mapping is done with the map directive. For full
#: details on advanced mapping including modal and per application
#: maps, see mapping <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/mapping/>. Some
#: quick examples to illustrate common tasks::

#:     # unmap a keyboard shortcut, passing it to the program running in kitty
#:     map kitty_mod+space
#:     # completely ignore a keyboard event
#:     map ctrl+alt+f1 discard_event
#:     # combine multiple actions
#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
#:     # multi-key shortcuts
#:     map ctrl+x>ctrl+y>z action

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

#: Window management {{{

#: New window

# map kitty_mod+enter new_window
# map cmd+enter       new_window

#::  You can open a new kitty window running an arbitrary program, for

#::      # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#::      map f1 clear_terminal scroll active
#::      # Clear everything up to the line with the cursor
#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor active

#::  If you want to operate on all kitty windows instead of just the
#::  current one, use all instead of active.

#::  Some useful functions that can be defined in the shell rc files
#::  to perform various kinds of clearing of the current window:

#::  .. code-block:: sh

#::      clear-only-screen() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[2J"
#::      }

#::      clear-screen-and-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[3J"
#::      }

#::      clear-screen-saving-contents-in-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[22J"
#::      }

#::  For instance, using these escape codes, it is possible to remap
#::  Ctrl+L to both scroll the current screen contents into the
#::  scrollback buffer and clear the screen, instead of just clearing
#::  the screen. For ZSH, in ~/.zshrc, add:

#::  .. code-block:: zsh

#::      ctrl_l() {
#::          builtin print -rn -- $'\r\e[0J\e[H\e[22J' >"$TTY"
#::          builtin zle .reset-prompt
#::          builtin zle -R
#::      }
#::      zle -N ctrl_l
#::      bindkey '^l' ctrl_l

#: Clear up to cursor line

# map cmd+k clear_terminal to_cursor active

#: Reload kitty.conf

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file
# map ctrl+cmd+,   load_config_file

#::  Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it
#::  was loaded. Note that a handful of options cannot be dynamically
#::  changed and require a full restart of kitty. Particularly, when
#::  changing shortcuts for actions located on the macOS global menu
#::  bar, a full restart is needed. You can also map a keybinding to
#::  load a different config file, for example::

#::      map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#::  Note that all options from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#::  in other words the new configuration *replace* the old ones.

#: Debug kitty configuration

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config
# map opt+cmd+,    debug_config

#::  Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running
#::  with and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.

#: Send arbitrary text on key presses

#::  E.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all Hello World

#::  You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#::  client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For
#::  example::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#::  This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+A key
#::  combination. The text to be sent decodes ANSI C escapes
#::  <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/ANSI_002dC-
#::  Quoting.html> so you can use escapes like \e to send control
#::  codes or \u21fb to send Unicode characters (or you can just input
#::  the Unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). You can use
#::  `kitten show_key` to get the key escape codes you want to
#::  emulate.

#::  The first argument to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to
#::  activate the shortcut. The possible values are normal,
#::  application, kitty or a comma separated combination of them. The
#::  modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#::  for terminals, and kitty refers to the kitty extended keyboard
#::  protocol. The special value all means all of them.

#::  Some more examples::

#::      # Output a word and move the cursor to the start of the line (like typing and pressing Home)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\e[H
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\eOH
#::      # Run a command at a shell prompt (like typing the command and pressing Enter)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal,application some command with arguments\r

#: Open kitty Website

# map shift+cmd+/ open_url https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/

#: Hide macOS kitty application

# map cmd+h hide_macos_app

#: Hide macOS other applications

# map opt+cmd+h hide_macos_other_apps

#: Minimize macOS window

# map cmd+m minimize_macos_window

#: Quit kitty

# map cmd+q quit
